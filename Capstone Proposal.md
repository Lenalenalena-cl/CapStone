# Project Title

## Overview

AdoptMeow is a web application designed to help users find cats available for adoption within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The platform allows users to browse a list of available cats, search based on location and age, view detailed cat profiles, and contact shelters directly.

### Problem Space
Adopting a cat can require visiting multiple shelter websites, leading to a scattered user experience. AdoptMeow consolidates the available cats from shelters in the GTA into a single platform, making the adoption process more efficient and user-friendly.

### User Profile
Primary users: Individuals or families looking to adopt cats.

Special considerations:
Mobile-first design for easy browsing on smartphones.

### Features

As a user, I want to view a list of all cats available for adoption in the GTA.
As a user, I want to scroll back to the top of the cat list for easier navigation.
As a user, I want to search for cats by location and age, so that I can find cats that suit my preferences.
As a user, I want to view detailed profiles for each cat to learn more about them.
As a user, I want to view details about shelters and their available cats.
As a user, I want to open my default mail client by clicking on a shelterâ€™s email to communicate with them.
As a user, I want to sign in, sign up, and log out to personalize my experience.
As a user, I want to send adoption applications or inquiries via the website.
As a user, I want to like or unlike cats to track my preferred ones.
